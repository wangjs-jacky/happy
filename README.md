> **Paws** is an independently maintained product and codebase that originated from
> [Happy](https://github.com/slopus/happy). It has its own app builds, CLI package,
> release pipeline, roadmap, and website. The retained GitHub fork relationship is historical
> attribution, not an upstream-sync commitment.

## 🚀 Quick Start

**1. Install the CLI on your computer**

```bash
npm install -g @wangjs-jacky/paws
```

This provides the `paws` and `happy` commands (plus `paws-mcp` / `happy-mcp` for MCP integration).

**2. Get the app on your phone**

Download the latest **Android APK** from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/wangjs-jacky/happy/releases)
(arm64, sideload install). A web app is also bundled with the self-hosted server.

**3. Wrap your agent and pair**

```bash
# Instead of claude / codex, run:
paws claude
# or
paws codex
```

Scan the QR code with the app to pair — from then on the session is mirrored to your phone.

**4. (Optional) Let your phone start new sessions**

```bash
paws daemon start
```

With the daemon running, the app can spawn fresh sessions on this machine remotely — no desk visit needed.

For source installs, server options, app builds and troubleshooting, read the
[Getting Started guide](docs/getting-started.md) ([中文版](docs/getting-started.zh-CN.md)).

## 🐾 Why Paws?

- 📱 **Remote control for your coding agents** — Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode and other ACP-compatible agents
- 🔔 **Reliable push notifications** — FCM-backed Android delivery through the current Expo Push integration, including foreground alerts
- 🖼️ **Full image workflow** — attach images when creating a session, HEIC auto-normalization, fullscreen image viewer
- ⚡ **Switch devices instantly** — take over from phone or desktop with one keypress
- 🔐 **End-to-end encrypted** — the sync server only ever relays ciphertext; your code and conversations stay private
- 🏠 **Fully self-hostable** — run your own sync server (Docker, zero-config PGlite) *and* your own OTA update channel

## 🔧 How It Works

```text
Mobile / Web App
    |
    |  HTTP + WebSocket, end-to-end encrypted payloads
    v
Sync Server (self-hosted or upstream)
    |
    |  encrypted sync, machine presence, session state
    v
paws CLI / daemon on your computer
    |
    v
Claude Code / Codex / Gemini / OpenCode / ACP-compatible agents
```

The CLI wraps your agent's terminal session. Keep working locally as usual; when you pick the
session up from your phone it seamlessly switches to remote mode, and any keypress on your
keyboard takes it back.

## ✨ What Paws Adds

| **Branding** | Marmot mascot, `Paws` app name, splash & mascot-linked theme |
| **CLI distribution** | Published on npm as [`@wangjs-jacky/paws`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wangjs-jacky/paws) with trusted-publishing CI |
| **Android push** | FCM-backed Android notifications delivered through the current Expo Push service integration; notifications also show in-foreground and open the target session |
| **Images** | Restored image upload, first-screen attachments, fullscreen viewer, HEIC normalization for vision models |
| **OTA updates** | Self-hosted OTA pipeline with `preview` / `production` channels, per-PR preview builds, and a [version browser site](https://wangjs-jacky.github.io/happy-ota-site/) to pin any historical build via QR code |
| **Extras** | Health check-in dashboard fed by your own Markdown notes, desktop screenshot capture, session attach command, and a steady stream of UX fixes |

## 📦 Project Components

| Package | What it is |
|---------|------------|
| [`packages/happy-app`](packages/happy-app) | Mobile + web client (Expo) — ships as the **Paws** app |
| [`packages/happy-cli`](packages/happy-cli) | The `paws` CLI — wraps Claude Code / Codex, daemon, MCP tools |
| [`packages/happy-server`](packages/happy-server) | Self-hostable sync server with bundled web app |
| [`packages/happy-agent`](packages/happy-agent) | CLI for controlling agents remotely (create, send, monitor) |
| [`packages/happy-wire`](packages/happy-wire) | Shared wire types & Zod schemas |

## 🏠 Self-Hosting

The sync server is a single Docker container with zero-config embedded PGlite (or external
PostgreSQL). Point the CLI and app at it and the loop is closed — nothing leaves your network:

```bash
export HAPPY_SERVER_URL=http://your-server:3005
paws claude
```

See the [Getting Started guide](docs/getting-started.md) and the
[intranet deployment manual](docs/selfhost-intranet-deploy.md) for full instructions.

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

Paws began as a fork of [**Happy**](https://github.com/slopus/happy) by the
[slopus](https://github.com/slopus) team — a brilliant piece of engineering, generously MIT-licensed.
The `happy` package on npm and the Happy apps in the App Store / Play Store belong to the original project;
Paws ships its own CLI (`@wangjs-jacky/paws`) and its own app builds.
