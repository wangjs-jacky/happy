## Summary

- Replace the desktop tab switcher with a persistent icon rail, organization pane, session pane, chat, and Capability Hub while preserving historical entry points.
- Let the organization pane collapse from the session title and resize independently, with width and collapsed state persisted across reloads.
- Give Relationship Advisor its own compact conversation index before entering a streaming chat detail.
- Preserve the existing mobile staged drawer behavior and existing Paws theme tokens.

## E2E acceptance

| Case | Result | Spec / rerun | Mobile video | Report / Trace |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| THREE-NAV-01 | Passed ordinary and recording modes | `[RELATIONSHIP-ADVISOR-HISTORY]` | [H.264 recording](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wangjs-jacky/happy/6b3ff7a3a30a2ba2fd737924f6f17b80f306f9b6/docs/pr-evidence/three-level-navigation/case-1-e2e.mp4) | Isolated local report; environment removed after run |
| THREE-NAV-02 | Passed ordinary and recording modes | `[THREE-LEVEL-NAV-PC]` | [H.264 recording](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wangjs-jacky/happy/6b3ff7a3a30a2ba2fd737924f6f17b80f306f9b6/docs/pr-evidence/three-level-navigation/case-2-e2e.mp4) | Isolated local report; environment removed after run |

- Environment and side effects: isolated Server/Web environments; no production account, daemon, or model call; runner removed every environment.
- Mobile playback: not yet confirmed on a separate mobile device.
- Visual comparability: all four screenshots use 1280×900, DPR 1, and Gingham dark; the two Before images were captured from `origin/main` with the same fixtures and theme.
- Known gaps: the desktop layout changes are PC/Web-specific; existing mobile staged drawer behavior is covered by component tests and the existing mobile E2E case.
