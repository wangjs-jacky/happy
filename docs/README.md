# Paws Documentation

This folder documents Paws: the app, CLI, self-host server, protocols, deployment, and current product direction. Paws is independently maintained; the retained GitHub fork relationship is historical attribution, not an upstream-sync commitment.

Internal package names and compatibility identifiers still use `happy-*` in many places. Keep those exact names when they refer to code, environment variables, storage paths, wire packages, or the `happy` CLI alias. Historical plans, research, and architecture records may also retain the original Happy name so that links and implementation history stay traceable.

## Conventions
- Product-facing prose uses **Paws**.
- Paths, package names, environment variables, storage directories, and protocol fields use their exact implementation names, even when they contain `happy` or `HANDY`.
- `plans/`, `research/`, `experimental/`, and `competition/` are historical or exploratory records; do not treat every statement in them as current product behavior.
- Examples are illustrative. Current package manifests, `packages/happy-app/app.config.js`, workflows, and source code are canonical.
